# PyPlag

PyPlag is a Python library that facilitates the use of JPlag from a Python context, specifically for the use case of collusion detection in competitive programming. As such, PyPlag performs some post-processing on the .jplag files generated by JPlag, such as culling comparisons between submissions made by the same author or team.

## Usage

To use PyPlag, import the pyplag library and create a PyPlag object, like so:

```py
# N.B. — PyPlag is still in early development — this example is not yet fully implemented

from pyplag import PyPlag, PyPlagSettings, PyPlagSubmission, PyPlagReport

pyplag: PyPlag = PyPlag(PyPlagSettings())

submissions: list[PyPlagSubmission] = []
for sub in my_data_source():
    # As of now, submmission files must be sent as string-values. Passing by file will be supported eventually.
    files: dict[str, str] = {}
    for filename in sub.files:
        with open(filename) as f:
            files[filename] = f.read()

    submissions.append(PyPlagSubmission(sub.id, sub.author_id, sub.language, files))

report: PyPlagReport = pyplag.run('python3', submissions)
```
